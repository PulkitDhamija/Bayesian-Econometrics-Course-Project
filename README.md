# Bayesian-Econometrics-Course-Project
This repository contains the code for Bayesian Quantile regression for binary models written from scratch.....<br>
I got inspiration for this from my Pofessor of Bayesian Econometrics who is the author of the paper "Bayesian Quantile Regression for Ordinal Models."
